In this project I used 4 different API's <br>
Firstly, to start work you should copy this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/speedyjohn/asitu_back_2.git
```
Secondly, run npm install:
```bash
npm i
```

To run the server, we are using Express with https to make queries to API's<br>
So, there are 4 different API's: <br>
Open Weather(Weather data),<br>
Leaflet(Map),<br>
Catfact(Random fact about cats),<br>
Joke(Random funny joke to not be sad) <br>
Also, we are using dotenv to use .env file<br>
In .env we are storing our Open Weather API key
